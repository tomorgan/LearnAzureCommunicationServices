Links for all blog posts can be found at <a href="https://learnacs.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learnACS.dev</a>. I blog at <a href="https://blog.thoughtstuff.co.uk">thoughtstuff.co.uk</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TomMorganTS?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscribe to my YouTube channel</a> for videos about ACS (and much more!). </p>

You should understand the risks of hosting your own ACS instance and associated web-based entry point on the public internet before proceeding. If you end up sharing your access tokens, or there’s a bug in the code and you end up with a huge hosting bill, or find yourself unwittingly hosting other people’s rooms, you’re on your own.
