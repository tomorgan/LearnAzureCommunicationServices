Azure Communication Services (ACS) is Microsoft’s latest platform which empowers developers to build communication capabilities into their applications. 

In a blog series of 15 posts (and counting!) and accompanying videos I’m going to talk about what ACS is, what it can do and how you can use it. It’s a series aimed at developers but if you’re non-technical you will still get a lot out of the first few days where we discuss capabilities and considerations. You can read all the blog posts at [learnacs.dev](https://learnacs.dev) or at my blog: [blog.thoughtstuff.co.uk](https://blog.thoughtstuff.co.uk)

I hope you find this series of blog posts useful on your ACS journey. I’d love to hear your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomorgan).
